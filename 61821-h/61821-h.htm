<p><span class="uppercase">merry</span> Christmas,
Miss Cossart!
Why, you
don’t mean to say
you are not coming
to church! I
thought you’d be
sure to make a
fresh start on
Christmas Day!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m a regular
heathen! I
haven’t been to church
twice the whole year!
I can’t stand stuffy
places, and I expect
the scent of the flowers
will make it twice as
bad as usual to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re coming anyway, Miss
Cholmondeley? Shall we start? It’ll
be hot walking, and I hate that
omnibus, and the carros are so slow.
Come along. Miss Cossart will tell them
that we’ve started.”</p>

<p>Sheila hung back a moment; she had
an instinct that her aunt would be vexed,
but she never knew how to refuse
Ronald’s suggestions, made in a half
masterful, half-pleading way. He took
her prayer-book and walked off beside
her, whilst Effie looked after them with
a rather stormy light in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Does she really never come to
church?” asked Ronald, as they took
their way along the sunny road together.</p>

<p>“She has only been once or twice
since I have known her,” answered
Sheila. “She thinks the air might
bring on asthma.”</p>

<p>Ronald was silent for a few minutes,
swinging his stick. His face was rather
graver than its wont.</p>

<p>“Somehow I don’t like to see people
staying away from church like that. I
know it isn’t fashionable to say such
things, but I have a feeling that church
is the place to help us to get the better
of our infirmities, bodily and spiritual.
My brother Guy will struggle out to
church when he goes nowhere else, and
I’m sure he is never the worse for it. I
don’t like to hear a girl call herself a
heathen in that flippant way. She must
remember she won’t be judged by the
standard of the heathens!”</p>

<p>It was so unusual for Ronald to speak
seriously that Sheila was quite surprised,
yet somehow it seemed to draw them
closer together. That was how Oscar
sometimes talked, and upon this Christmas
morning her thoughts were very
much with Oscar. It was the first
Christmas they had ever spent apart,
and Sheila was a little bit homesick in
consequence.</p>

<p>“I should hate not to go to church on
Christmas morning,” she said. “It
seems to bring us near to everybody all
round the world. It is so hard to realise
that it is Christmas here. A few days
ago when it rained so, and the snow
came on the mountains, one could fancy,
perhaps, that it might be winter somewhere;
but with this glorious sunshine!
It seems almost ridiculous!”</p>

<p>“Do you like Christmas out here,
Miss Sheila?” asked Ronald, who
often called her that, and sometimes
“Miss Baby,” “or would you rather be
at home?”</p>

<p>Sudden tears came quite unexpectedly
into Sheila’s eyes. She looked down
that Ronald might not see them.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I have a home exactly&mdash;now,”
she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly, a flash in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“But surely your home is with your
uncle and aunt?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Sheila a little unsteadily,
“in a way it is, but sometimes
it doesn’t seem quite a real home.”</p>

<p>A tear plashed down, but Sheila turned
her head away, and then looked back
with a brave smile.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to say that, perhaps. It
sounds ungrateful, but, of course, it
can’t be the same as one’s own house,
and last Christmas we were so happy,
and I never thought of things changing
like this!”</p>

<p>Ronald, of course, knew all Sheila’s
story by this time. He looked the
sympathy he felt.</p>

<p>“I know, I know. It must have been
very hard! But you are happy with
your relations, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Y&mdash;yes,” answered Sheila a little
doubtfully, adding after a brief pause;
“only sometimes I think my aunt doesn’t
much like me now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t think that! Everybody
has ups and downs, you know. We all
of us have our cross days.”</p>

<p>“You don’t,” answered Sheila, “nor
Miss Adene, nor any of you! But Aunt
Cossart is sometimes very glum and cross
with me.”</p>

<p>There was a little gleam in Ronald’s
eyes. It is a known fact that lookers on
sometimes see most of the game, and it
had not been unnoticed by the Dumaresq
party that Sheila was rather out of
favour with her aunt. They could see
the reason plain enough. The hotel
was filling up now, and still Sheila held
her place as the favourite, and small
notice comparatively was bestowed upon
Effie. There was no blinking the
matter that Effie bored people. Her
sprightliness was not of an engaging
kind, it had a contradictious defiance
about it that was irritating, and her
shallow theories and self-centred way of
looking at life made her conversation
monotonous and tiresome. When she
allowed herself to forget herself, she
could be much more agreeable; but
generally she could not get away from
herself, and the result was disastrous
for herself.</p>

<p>Some other young girls had come,
and Sheila would romp up and down
the house with them, leading them
into fun and frolic, teaching them the
Washington Post up and down corridors
or verandah, throwing herself into games
of which she was the life and soul, and
in which Ronald was always an able
assistant, and in a hundred little ways
making life merry for herself and others,
whilst Effie never seemed able to
amalgamate in the merry crowd.</p>

<p>Health might be one cause; but
another was a certain quality in herself.
She was so used to being the first
thought and consideration with those
about her, that if she was not that, she
did not know how to take any place at
all. Her mother would look on anxious
and dissatisfied, utterly perplexed to
find the answer to the question always
forcing itself upon her. At last she
reached the conclusion that Sheila was
somehow in fault. If Sheila were
different and made Effie welcome, things
would go differently. Effie ought not
to be sitting with a book in the drawing-room
whilst the young folks were frolicking
outside. It was not right or proper;
only if Effie did go out to them, she
speedily returned, not finding any fun
in what amused them.</p>

<p>So Sheila got into disgrace with her
aunt by imperceptible degrees, and upon
this Christmas morning her heart was
rather heavy within her, though she
scarcely knew why.</p>

<p>The service, however, did her good,
though she could not always keep back
her tears. The building recalled no
associations; it was but an ugly little
place, something between a round and
a square, the authorities refusing to
permit a cruciform church to be
built. The flowers, too, did not look
at all Christmas-like in spite of a
few bits of holly here and there; arum
lilies were the great feature with roses
and poinsettias. But the familiar hymns
brought home back, and Sheila choked
once or twice, thinking of Oscar, the
father who had left them so suddenly,
and the dear old home she never
expected to see again.</p>

<p>She walked home with Miss Adene,
who talked kindly and comfortingly to
her. She had seen that the child was
in danger of getting in trouble, and had
warned Ronald to be careful; for she
half-suspected Mrs. Cossart’s ambitions
for her daughter. Ronald would never
think of such a thing himself, nor would
Sheila, who had the mind of a child in
all such matters; but Miss Adene had
seen a good deal of the world, and her
kindly eyes were very keen and quick.</p>

<p>“Don’t be downhearted, little girl,”
she said, “life is never all sunshine for
any of us. We should not be good for
much if it were. We want our east
winds and rainy days, as well as the
plants and flowers, to make us thrive.
We should be dry and arid like a desert
if we had nothing but our own way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_643"></a>{643}</span>
all our lives, and no little crosses to
bear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so; only it seems
hard when people are unjust. Aunt is
vexed with me, and she won’t say why.
She calls me rude and forward; but I
don’t think I am, do you? I like fun,
and they all play. Why should I be
left out?”</p>

<p>Christmas was a gay day at the New
Hotel, and nobody was left out in the
general fun. The whole place was
decorated with greenery&mdash;trailers of
giant smilax twenty feet long, making
the task of decoration easy. They were
wreathed round the balusters of the
staircase and festooned overhead in the
dining-room, the waiters and maids
got “tips,” and were more smiling than
ever, whilst guests exchanged greetings
and little gifts, and the table reproduced
the typical fare of England&mdash;turkey,
roast beef, and plum puddings all
aflame!</p>

<p>There was tennis in the afternoon, and
dancing for the young people in the
evening; and Effie for the first time
went down to the billiard-room, and
Miss Adene kindly interested herself in
getting partners for her amongst some
of the visitors from the houses on the
island, who had come to join the fun.</p>

<p>Miss Adene had several acquaintances
in Madeira, and many persons had called
upon Lady Dumaresq and her husband.
Sheila from being much with them had
received invitations to go out with
them; and at first the girl had accepted,
not knowing how to refuse. This had
been another cause of offence; and now
Miss Adene was good-naturedly seeking
to induce their friends to call upon the
Cossarts; and Mrs. Cossart had been
made happy to-night by an invitation
for New Year’s Eve to one of the biggest
quintas in the island, where there would
be a grand entertainment, culminating in
a giant display of fireworks, which display,
they heard, would be universal all
over the island. For it was the custom in
Madeira to welcome in the New Year by
a perfect storm of fireworks. Even the
poorest of the people spent their little
savings in a few squibs or crackers.
Every child who had a “bit” to spend
laid it out in fireworks. Miss Adene
said it was the most curious sight possible&mdash;the
whole island, as far as the eye
could see, alight and ablaze; for as the
quintas and smaller houses ran right up
into the hills to a considerable height,
and extended far on either side, the
panorama of coloured lights was something
unique.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it nice that we have been asked
to the big party?” asked Effie that
night. “Not that I care so very much
about parties, but I like to see all that
is characteristic of a place. I suppose
you were asked too, Sheila?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” answered Sheila gleefully;
but Mrs. Cossart, who was in the
room, said coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am not sure about your going,
Sheila.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aunt! Why not?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that it is suitable; a
big party like that, and your father not a
year dead. I don’t know if it is seemly.”</p>

<p>Sheila was silent; she had never
thought of that, certainly. It seemed a
long, long time now since her father’s
death; and even in the summer, when
her loss was so recent, she had gone
about with her cousins to little friendly
gatherings at houses where they were
intimate. Now here, in this far-away
country, where nobody knew them, the
objection did sound a little far-fetched;
but Sheila did not know how to answer
it, though her face fell.</p>

<p>“I know you don’t think about things
as other girls would,” said Mrs. Cossart
with a little asperity; “you go romping
and playing and dancing just as though
you had never had a loss of any kind,
and I haven’t checked you, because I
don’t want a scene every day, and you
are so self-willed. But this big party is
another affair. Why, you have not even
a dress fit for it. I never thought of
your going out to regular parties. No,
I don’t think it would do at all.”</p>

<p>For a moment Sheila was tempted to
rebel. She had heard so much about
this New Year’s Eve party and she did
so want to see it, and she did like the
lights and music and flowers, the little
dancing there was likely to be, and the
gay greetings when the New Year came
in. It did seem hard to be left out!
But then the remembrance came over
her of the words she had heard spoken
in church, of Miss Adene’s kindly talk,
of the resolutions she had made for
herself. So gulping down her disappointment
and sense of injury, she
answered meekly&mdash;</p>

<p>“Very well, Aunt Cossart. I suppose
you know best. I will stay at home.”</p>

<p>For a moment Effie looked as though
she would like to speak, but then the
impulse passed, and she said nothing.
It had flashed into Effie’s head that it
would be nice to go out without Sheila.
Effie had begun to think a good deal
about Ronald Dumaresq. Her mother
had unconsciously led her to do this,
though not with intention. Effie had been
interested once in Cyril, but she had had
her faith in him rather shaken, and his
image was waxing proportionately faint.
Ronald was the leading figure in her
little world now, and when the evening
came at last, and she was being dressed
for the great party, she was more particular
than ever in her life before, and
Sheila’s clever tasteful fingers were
called into requisition again and again
before she could be satisfied.</p>

<p>But at last all was done to her satisfaction.
She looked as well as it was
possible for her to look, and Sheila
admired her cordially. She would not
let herself be dull; she declared she
should sit up and watch the fireworks
from the verandah, where a fine view
was to be obtained, and as there were
many people in the hotel who would be
staying, she would not be left alone.</p>

<p class="p2">Bang! Bang! Bang! Sheila started
from her doze in a snug corner of the
verandah, and behold the island was a
blaze of coloured lights, whilst the noise
was like that of a bombarded city. She
started up and ran forward, and then
gave a little startled cry, for there was
Ronald putting out his hand for hers,
whilst he said in merry friendly tones&mdash;</p>

<p>“A happy New Year to you, Sheila!”</p>

<p>“Oof, how you startled me! But you
are over there!” she cried laughing,
and pointing to the quinta up in the
hills, where a splendid show of rockets
marked the exact spot.</p>

<p>“Am I? I thought I was here, but
no matter. Here or there, I meant to
be the first to wish you a happy New
Year!”</p>

<p>“How nice of you!” cried Sheila,
bubbling over with delight at the beautiful
sight before her, and the happy feeling
of having a friend at her side, “but
you did go there surely?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I showed up and did my
duty; but somehow it seemed dull and
flat. Something was wanting. Then,
you know, this is the place of all others
for seeing the whole panorama of the
illumination. Up there you are too
much in the middle of it. So I just
made my escape, got a fellow to run
me down to the bottom of the hill, and
here I am. Are you glad to see me,
Sheila?”</p>

<p>She looked frankly into his eyes, but
saw there something that made her
suddenly drop her own. With a new
sense of shyness she dropped his arm,
yet her voice had a happy ring in it as
she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you. I wish
you a happy New Year too.”</p>

<p>“And I mean to get one,” said
Ronald, suddenly possessing himself of
her hand.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HINTON ST. GEORGE.</p></div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a bright day in early spring&mdash;the ash-buds
still look quite black in the front of March&mdash;as
we mount slowly the steep hill that leads
to the quiet village of Hinton St. George.
The fresh air breathes out vigour, but still we
rest near the top to look back over the lovely
browns and purples of the plain below dotted
with red-tiled barns and towers of churches&mdash;Lopen,
Merriott, South Petherton&mdash;built of
the soft Ham stone of the county.</p>

<p>The road we go by has a rare charm, with
tall ash-hedges not yet lopped to the shabby
level demanded by the new injunctions. The
crescent bending ash saplings with their ebony
tips look to be some guard of halberdiers ready
to marshal whichever earl eventually wins the
day and comes to the old home to claim his
heritage.</p>

<p>Primrose buds look out from the hedge-rows,
but there is not yet much cheerful colour in
the landscape. After the ash saplings come
elder-bushes, whose boughs are just breaking
in a sad green tinged with purple. The only
warm colour that Dame Nature has taken
on her brush is the deep blue of the hills
that lie beyond Seavington and Shepton
Beauchamp.</p>

<p>Busy folk tramping through noisy London
streets are much exercised just now about the
law-suit that is to be fought over this far-off
spot. What a contrast there is between the
distant city and this still village so remote
that no builder has spoiled the quiet street,
the houses with latticed panes and generous
bow-windows, the old stone cross with its
mutilated figure, and the long low stone farm
with green palings sparkling in the sunlight!</p>

<p>Yet it was in the London church of St.
Martin’s-in-the-Fields that Queen Mary
Stuart’s gaoler, Sir Amyas Poulett, was buried
in 1588, and this most remarkable of a long
line of Pouletts was not brought to Hinton&mdash;perhaps
up this very road&mdash;till 1728, when no
room could be found for him in Gibbs’ new
church. This transference seems to form
a link between the busy city and the quiet
village.</p>

<p>Another bend brings us to the beautiful
perpendicular church with its brightly gilded
weather-cock dinted by the shots of a past
earl, who used to practise shooting at the vane
from the adjoining gardens.</p>

<p>Very lovely is the old churchyard, with the
great cedars in the garden beyond for a background,
and the tall tower, characteristic of
the county, softened into the mellowest greyish
yellow and flecked with lichens. We linger
over the grave-stones, of which many have
some link with the Pouletts, and notice the
curious Somersetshire name of Tryphena on
the tomb of one old servant who had lived in
“exemplary servitude” with the family for
forty-four years, dying in 1801. On an altar-tomb,
with date 1691, is the curious inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse indent0">She a saint in Heaven free from misery,” etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Over the pretty turf crosses, which are a
peculiarity of this churchyard, a gay peacock
walks, very unconscious that he is the old
emblem of that immortality which shall survive
“when all that seems shall suffer shock.”</p>

<p>Through the deep porch we pass into the
church where the pallid marble monuments of
many Pouletts go far to overpower the little
building, but are relieved by the warm tones
of the pinkish fawn stone roof of the chancel,
the tender yellow of the Ham stone columns,
and the unassuming white plaster of the walls.
A beautiful window by Clayton and Bell sends
red and purple lights along the stone floor
that rest on the heads of little Elizabethan
Pouletts who kneel in prayerful line beneath
their placid parents in ruff and doublet,
seeking&mdash;</p>

<p>We do not linger long over the virtues of
the earls of last century, though we are amused
at the wire-drawn periods of the epitaph to
the Honourable <i>Anne</i> Poulett, fourth son of
the first Earl Poulett, to whom Queen Anne
was godmother. A suite of rooms was prepared
for the Queen in the great house hidden
in its cedars, and her bed used to be shown
there; but death called her to follow her
eighteen dead babies before the visit came to
pass. She stood sponsor for the fourth son
of the first earl and named him Anne just as
she did Lord Anne Hamilton, the third son of
the Jacobite duke who was killed by Lord
Mohun in the famous Hyde Park duel described
by Thackeray in <i>Esmond</i>. Lord
Anne Poulett’s epitaph tells us that his
“sedate fortitude, propriety of judgment, and
universal knowledge, could not avert that
death which tore him from his afflicted
family”!</p>

<p>As we mount some steps into the Earl’s
great pew, upholstered in red cloth, we pass
a severely simple pulpit which is so in harmony
with the church that it seems to melt into it,
and leave all to the eloquence of the preacher.
The low stone rail, bound with fair worked
brass, recalls George Herbert’s words about
the reading-desk and pulpit in his church of
Layton Ecclesia, “for he would often say
Prayer and Preaching, being equally useful,
might agree like brethren and have an equal
honour and estimation.” The red pew is
spoiled by a very ugly window which, happily,
is so far back from the main aisle of the church
that it does not spoil the general effect. A
little door leads us down into a space which
was perhaps once the Lady Chapel, and which
contains many monuments of great interest.</p>

<p>Much might be written about the early
Paulets from Pawlet, near Bridgwater, and
their descendant who wedded a Deneband,
and so came to Hinton St. George; but in
this family the chief interest centres in the
early sixteenth century and the age of Elizabeth.
In the mailed warriors under the north wall
with their dames in curious head-dresses we
see probably the warlike Sir Amias, who
helped defeat Lambert Simnel at Newark in
the days of Henry VII., built much at Hinton,
and left his mark on the Middle Temple in
London, where chiefly he lived. Beyond lies
his son Sir Hugh, who helped Henry VIII.
in his French war with Francis I., and is said
to have put Wolsey in the stocks when he
was a youth at Lymington School. This Sir
Hugh perhaps helped to bring misfortune on
the house, for he had the ill-fated office laid
upon him of being supervisor of all the manors,
etc., lately belonging to Richard Whiting, last
abbot of Glastonbury.</p>

<p>But by far the most interesting monument
in the whole church is that in the west wall of
this chapel to the memory of Sir Amyas
Poulett, son of Sir Hugh, and gaoler of Mary
Queen of Scots during the last two years of
her life. It is seldom indeed that so much
personal character is expressed in marble as
in the curious veins of this pale alabaster.
One would think that many a Londoner must
have paused, struck by the stern even irritable
face, before the monument was removed from
St. Martin’s, where it was situate so long
under the same roof as Nell Gwynne and
many another notable. How strangely it
brings us into touch with past times to look
at this strong face of the man who had so
much to put up with! There he lies motionless
in ruff and doublet upon a marble pillow,
and yet he moved in the stirring world we know
so well from Froude’s vivid pages and Alexandre
Dumas’ bustling novels. In 1576 he was sent
ambassador by Elizabeth to that frivolous
court of Henry III., the king of favourites,
who lives again in the pages of <i>Chicot the
Jester</i>, with his swarms of little spaniels and
his effeminate hands smeared with cream,
surrounded by the plots and counter-plots
of the Guises and the aged queen-mother
Catherine of Medici.</p>

<p>Whilst Sir Amyas was in Paris, the
negotiations were afoot for marrying Queen
Elizabeth, a woman of forty-six, to the
French King Henry’s brother Alençon,
Duke of Anjou, a lad of twenty-three, “a
small brown creature, deeply pock-marked,
with a large head, a knobbed nose, and a
hoarse croaking voice.” When he came to
visit her in 1579, Elizabeth pretended to
like him and called him her “grenouille,”
her frog-prince, but the English nation had
not forgotten the massacre of St. Bartholomew
seven short years ago, and would have none of
him. Sir Philip Sidney wrote out his indignation
in an honest memorial to the Queen,
and then retired for some time from Court to
Wilton, where he wrote the <i>Arcadia</i>. On
Stubbs, a Puritan pamphleteer, who opposed
the match, the Queen vented her spleen by
having his hand chopped off by the common
hangman. “Long live Queen Elizabeth!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646">{646}</a></span>
cried the loyal Englishman as he waved his
hat with his left hand. Feeling such as this
proved to the Queen that her Englishmen
would have none of the Italianated foreigner,
but with her usual intricate diplomacy she
kept up the negotiations for years, and Sir
Amyas Poulett had to bear the brunt of
Parisian indignation. “I have been baited
here for a month or more as a bear at a stake,
and had nothing to say,” he writes, “but
stood still at my defence for fear to take
hurt.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HINTON ST. GEORGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>We can fancy that the knowledge which
Sir Amyas gained of French stratagems and
spoils made him a suitable warder for the
resourceful Scottish queen whom he watched
over at Tutbury, Chartley and Fotheringay
with a surly fidelity, for the last two out of
her eighteen years’ captivity. His restless
desire to force his own particular tenets upon
her must have added to the trials of her last
moments, though his honest refusal to let
her be murdered by any secret assassin made
the last sad pageant of execution possible, in
which her unwavering fortitude won for her
the sympathy of posterity. Sir Amyas liked
plain dealing, and seems to have fretted much
at the tortuous policy of Walsingham and
Burghley. He discovered a priest in disguise
in the Queen’s household at gloomy Tutbury,
but knew not what to do with him, because
Elizabeth, as he said, “so dandled the
Catholics.” Sir Amyas yielded to Walsingham
so far as to give in, perhaps perforce,
to the shameful plot which entrapped Mary
into a treasonable correspondence carried on
by means of a water-tight box at the bottom
of the ale-casks supplied to her at Chartley
by a brewer from Burton, and then shamelessly
copied for Walsingham. This double-dealing
must have been grievous to the old
man, and the terrible responsibility laid upon
him, added to the pangs of the gout, shortened
his own life. Poor Queen Mary was so
unconscious of the toils she was in that
hope improved her health, her swollen legs
healed, and she was able to ride hunting
with the hounds and kill a deer with her
cross-bow.</p>

<p>Stand with me in fancy in the little chapel
at Hinton, and recall some of the strange
scenes beheld by that marble face.</p>

<p>Think of the sunny August morning in
1586, when Sir Amyas persuaded the unconscious
queen to ride out nine miles to Tixall
and kill a buck in Sir Walter Aston’s park.
Mary is in high spirits, perhaps her many
plots have seared her conscience, and if she
does know of the purposed assassination of
Elizabeth, it seems to her no high price to
pay for her liberty. Sir Amyas on the other
hand knows that Babington’s conspiracy is
discovered, that he has had to flee from the
forest of St. John’s Wood, and that in a
few moments Queen Mary will be arrested
for high treason. Deeply as he detests her
Popish wiles, a little sympathy must surely
cross his harsh features when the armed men
whom she hails as her deliverers arrest her as
a traitor in the Queen’s name.</p>

<p>Again. The fortnight of neglect and
hardship at Tixall is over, and the queen
returns to Chartley with her doom upon her
to find her treasures and secrets all torn open,
and her favourite attendant Barbara Curle
stricken by terror to a bed of sickness with
the new-born baby unchristened at her side.
You can fancy the furrowed forehead of Sir
Amyas as he harshly refuses to christen the
poor babe by the traitor’s name of Mary, and
the queen, ever with an instinct for the drama
of history, as she promptly lays the infant on
her lap and baptises it Mary in the Name of
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The weeks fly past. Elizabeth will not sign
the death-warrant, but has a letter written to
Poulett in which she roundly complains of
his want of love and zeal for not having found
some way to shorten the life of the Scottish
Queen. The letter reaches Sir Amyas at
five in the evening, and before an hour has
passed he has written the letter, which you
may see to this day, to say in hot haste, “God
forbid that I should make so fowle a shipwracke
of my conscience or leave so great a
blot to my poor posteritie to shed blood
without law or warrant.” Sir Amyas had
to put up with Elizabeth’s angry pacings to
and fro, and her words that he was “a dainty
and precise fellow who would promise much
and perform nothing,” but her later letters
to him suggest that in the end she was not
sorry that the rough honest man had stood
like a rock.</p>

<p>It must have shaken most men’s fortitude
to witness the terrible scene when Queen
Mary knelt in the hall at Fotheringay and
recited the penitential psalms in Latin and
English in deep tones that sounded above the
Puritan prayers of the men who refused her
the last sacraments of her church and met to
see her die. When the last moment came,
she knelt calmly by the block among her
black-robed executioners, herself clothed in
blood-red from head to foot, and never
flinched when the blow swerved and fell a
second time.</p>

<p>In any case Sir Amyas only lived eighteen
months after the Queen’s execution, and died
soon after his return from the negotiations at
Ostend for peace with Spain. Perhaps he
endured hardships in that devastated Netherland
country, where partridges were plentiful
because the tilled land had become a wilderness.
In any case the negotiations did not
avert the Spanish Armada, and Sir Amyas
died in September, 1588, a month after it had
perished. He must have breathed more freely
when the waves closed over the Spanish
galleons, for in Queen Mary’s last letter to
the Spanish ambassador, Mendoza, she had
bidden him tell King Philip not to forget
how she had been used by certain men, and
among their names was that of Sir Amyas
Poulett.</p>

<p>Beneath the recumbent figure there is a
curious French epitaph to this quondam
Governor of Jersey, in which are some touching
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Non, non, je ne croy pas qu’un si petit de Terre</div>

<div class="verse indent0">Que ce preux Chavalier, ce renommé Seigneur,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Avoit acquis en Paix, avoit acquis en Guerre.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His widow Margaret contributed a loving
Latin epitaph, which may have been composed
by herself in this age when Latin was no
uncommon accomplishment for a lady. Queen
Elizabeth puts her royal initials above a verse
on the right hand of the figure&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>There are other inscriptions playing upon
the characteristic words of his motto, <i>Garde
la Foy</i>, and the three swords of his crest; but
it is time for us to leave the stone precincts
and mount the old tower, from which we get
an exquisite view of the surrounding country
and the rambling old house.</p>

<p>The most ancient part of the present building
was the work of Sir Amyas’ grandfather. The
present front was built by the first Earl
Poulett, Queen Anne’s minister. We cannot
help regretting the “right goodly manor place
of free stone with two goodly towers embattled
in the inner court,” which old Leland saw in
Henry VIII.’s days; but we may rejoice that
the pretty wings remain in which “the slabs
of the sandstone of the country forming the
outer walls are cut in the shape of the rounded
stones of the sea-shore.” When gay flowers
again relieve the long line of stone, and a
touch of green is added to the rows of white
jalousies, perhaps a look of home will return to
the old mansion.</p>

<p>The quiet park where deer haunt the glades
must have looked gay indeed when the grandson
of Elizabeth’s Sir Amyas entertained
Mary of Scotland’s grandson, Charles I., at
Hinton in 1644, with a loyalty that was ready
to face much and pay heavily for his allegiance
to the King. It was only fifty-five years from
the day of Queen Mary’s execution when the
two grandsons met at Hinton. Five short
years were to pass, and the head of Charles I.
fell from the block with a fortitude not unlike
that of his grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots.</p>

<p>A few years more, and Hinton is holding
high festival again, and feasting the Duke
of Monmouth with junketing in the park.
Almost directly after, the Duke was fleeing
from Sedgemoor to be captured in the Hampshire
fields, and travel to London and the
headsman’s axe on Tower Hill.</p>

<p>As we walk back past the closed windows
and fancy the treasures inside of portraits and
statues, and frames by Grinling Gibbons, we
find a poor dead thrush, called a “home-screech”
in these parts, because its note is
not so tuneful as that of its brother thrushes.
The bird and its empty nest expresses the
want we feel about this lovely spot with its
sad memories. The nest is too good and fair
to be left untenanted.</p>

<h3>PART V.</h3>

<p class="ph3">ADAPTABILITY TO CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> persons look upon plants as still life,
forgetting, or ignorant of, the fact that their
existence depends on the movement of the
juices which are embodied in them. This is
not even quiet in winter, when all about the
plant would seem dead indeed. There is
still motion being carried on, although it is
necessarily of a very feeble or languid nature.
There is perhaps only a very slight enlargement
of the buds, but there it is nevertheless; the
almost imperceptible development preparing
for spring’s coming.</p>

<p>If a small part of the cuticle of the <i>Vallisneria</i>,
an aquatic plant, is placed under the
microscope, there is visible in every one of
its tiny cells a number of little globules
coursing in order, round and round, faster
or slower, in a varying degree of motion, until
the portion under observation has exhausted
its vitality. And by a wonderful instinct&mdash;as
we say&mdash;the flowers of this species, male and
female, which grow on different plants, are
able to detach themselves at the right season.
That is, the male flowers can leave the plant
stems, and floating about on the stream, they
join the female flowers, and so the reproduction
is effected in them by a spontaneous action
on their part which is brought about in many
other cases by an outside agency, the action
of bees, for instance.</p>

<p>When the waters of a stream rise, another
aquatic plant, the <i>Kuppia Maritima</i> is able
to coil and uncoil its flower stalks, which are
curled in a spiral fashion; and, as the depth
of the water in which it grows changes, its
blossoms are always kept on a level with the
surface.</p>

<p>In plant as in animal life, there is this
wonderful power of accommodation to circumstances
which might otherwise prove entirely
adverse to the continuation of that life.
Instinct is the term applied to vegetable
as well as animal life. We use it for want
of a better, although it certainly does not
cover all that is implied in innumerable
instances.</p>

<p>A thoughtful writer says that instinct, which
belongs to the physiological expression of
life, has no other end or function than the
maintenance of these forms, whence it never
operates without manifesting effects in the
organic mechanism. Reason, on the other
hand, has no relation to the body, except as
the soul’s body or instrument; it belongs to
the soul purely, and may be exercised without
giving the slightest external token.</p>

<p>“The life whose phenomena are the
instincts impels us only to eat, to drink, to
propagate, to preserve our fabric safe and
sound; the spiritual life, the phenomena of
which are forms of reason, gives power, not to
do corporeal things, but to think and to rise
emotionally towards the source of life. It is
by reason of this supra-instinctive life that
man stands as the universal master.”</p>

<p>The great naturalist Buffon also says,
“Man thinks, hence he is master over creatures
which do not think.” And an ancient
author writes finely, “While other animals
bend their looks downwards to earth, He
gave to man a lofty countenance, commanded
him to lift his face to heaven, and behold with
upturned eyes the stars.”</p>

<p>This has been a digression into which the
use of the term instinct led me. Instinct
leads the carnivorous animal to feed on flesh;
but if this is scarce&mdash;even if fruit is plentiful,
and offers itself in profusion&mdash;the puma will
devour wild gooseberries and raspberries; so
will the coyote wolves in the Rocky Mountains.
I stayed for some time in a mountain region
in Colorado&mdash;the district in which I made my
notes for “Candelaria,” a story some of you
have perhaps read in the pages of this
magazine&mdash;and there in the autumn the big
bears would come in their heavy rolling gait
down the mountain-sides to devour the wild
fruits, “choke cherries” and the like.</p>

<p>The power of accommodation to the exigencies
of circumstance is so great that, as scientists
will tell you, species will often develop
through these, in time, an extra member. And
again, faculties and powers, by their non-use,
will desert us in time. Our power of adaptability
is in point of fact beyond calculation.
“All things are possible to him that believeth”
is a truth too little tested by most of us.</p>

<p>Could yon slender reed, which is swayed
by the slightest breeze, stand the fierce onslaught
of a tempest? No, but it bends
gracefully before it and escapes unhurt where
stouter stems have been snapped asunder.</p>

<p>And, to take a simile from the bird world,
all the herons, the different species of the
<i>Ardeidæ</i>, which have ordinarily a slow and
heavily flapping flight, when alarmed or
pursued by their natural enemies, have a habit
of easing themselves. They will disgorge
the food which they have just swallowed in
order to lighten themselves for more rapid
flight.</p>

<p>This reminds me of a little incident in my
own life. Some years ago I was in a collision
at sea; the bow of a large steamer ran into
the stern of the vessel in which I was, when
both were going at top speed, and both
vessels went down beneath the waters almost
as soon as we passengers, most of us in our
night clothing, had got free in the small boats.
Over fifty lives, unfortunately, were lost that
night, but only one woman out of very many
others perished. That need not have been,
but she was timid, and she would not risk
the leap that other women had had to make
down into the boat which waited for her ten
feet below. As soon as the boat in which I
was, arrived, a few hours later, alongside of
a rescuing steamer, the women were most of
them taken up into this by means of a rope and
band fastened round the waist, but I climbed
up a rope ladder which was overhung on the
side of the ship. In order to grasp this
firmly with both hands I had to lose my
hold of a bag I had contrived to save, in
which were some valuables very dear to me.
I put it down on the boat seat, and of course
I never saw it again. My precious things
were lost, but my life was saved. A poor
lady who was in the same wreck suffered a
still greater loss, and she was one of those
conservative sensitive natures who find it so
hard to adapt themselves to changeful circumstances.
She has never recovered her mental
balance since that terrible night.</p>

<p>To preserve a trustful, cheerful frame of
mind under adverse circumstances, to be able
to adjust one’s resources, one’s capabilities to
the exigencies of a life so liable to changes,
is a gift for which the possessor cannot be too
grateful to the Giver of all good gifts.</p>

<p>Science has been defined by someone as
“the discovery of the changeless in the ever-changing.”
I was sitting in a weak, fatigued
state of mind once in a train at a great terminus.
We were waiting for the moment of departure,
and not being drawn up to the end of the
platforms, trains moved constantly on either
side of us. To my tired head&mdash;I had lately
come off the sea, which had been a rough one&mdash;I
did not seem able to make out whether
it was our train or the other that was in motion
when this occurred. Presently my eyes found
a refuge in the contemplation of a massive
column within sight. So long as they rested
there, all was simple. I saw it was the others
that were in motion, and we were quiet.</p>

<p>God is the changeless amid the ever-changing.
If the eye of our soul is fixed on Him, all else
adjusts itself. We have “an anchor sure and
steadfast.”</p>

<p>The conies, says the wise man in the book
of Proverbs, “are but a feeble folk, yet make
they their houses in the rocks.” The conies
belong to the same family as do our rabbits,
but they have not paws suitable for burrowing,
and their homes are in the clefts of the
immovable rocks. Thither they flee to hide
themselves when the enemy is in pursuit, or
when the elements are adverse. They find tiny
fastnesses, where, protected from all stress of
weather, they can sleep in safety, and into
which the great birds of prey cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>For some situations our powers of adaptability
are all inadequate. The combat is too great
for our forces, and the best course, the wisest,
nay, often the only possible course lies in
flight and in seeking a haven of refuge, until,
as the Psalmist says, “the tyranny is overpast.”
“I will flee to the Rock to hide me.”
And as “that feeble folk, the conies” make
their houses in the rocks, so we, like the
wise man in the parable, build our house on
the Rock, not on the shifting foundations of
sand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox w175">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_648.jpg" width="175" height="197" alt='A' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">hot</span> August
day,
hot with
the heat
cherished
through a
sunny
fortnight
of rainless
days;
in which
the earth radiated
back to the
atmosphere the
warmth bestowed upon
her by the cloudless
skies, so that a light
haze overhung the broad plains, and lay like a
belt around the dark-foliaged trees and whitewashed
villages of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>It was a monotonous and little-varied scene,
yet the girl who was watching it from a
railway compartment, as the train sped past it,
found it full of interest and delight. It was
all so distinctly un-English, and poorly as it
might compare with the woody slopes and
fruitful orchards of the land she had left
behind her, these severe, hedgeless fields and
austere lines of tall poplars had to her a special
beauty of their own. She took little heed of
her travelling companions, so absorbed was
she in the novelty of her surroundings. And
she was conscious, too, that this was only the
beginning, that better things were in store for
her. One short night and day, and then&mdash;the
snowy mountains, hitherto visible only in
dreams, the green pastures and tinkling cattle-bells,
the climbing woods and glowing flowers.
Truly, for the realisation of such a vision all
past toil and patient expectation were well
worth endurance.</p>

<p>If she had been less occupied with her
observations, she might have noticed that one
of her fellow travellers was keenly interested
in her, and that the comic papers that were
littered on the seat beside him received very
little of his attention. A slight service
rendered at Dover apparently gave him, at
least in his own opinion, some sort of
proprietary interest in this young woman,
whose solitary journey seemed to him a
challenge to his attention. Nevertheless,
since they had entered the compartment, he
had not been able to obtain so much as a
glance from her. This, to one who was
accustomed to think himself irresistible, was
not a little irritating; a brilliant idea struck
him, and he now held out to her one of the
gaily-coloured periodicals. The familiarity of
his tone, coupled with the fact that she had
been accustomed to view such productions
with disgust, impelled her to decline it; but
remembering the relief she had felt at his help
on the way, she accepted with a shy hesitation.
The leaves fluttered in her hands, but the
pictures that caught her eye, as she turned the
paper over, distressed and annoyed her. In
another moment she summoned up courage to
hand it back to the owner.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;don’t you like ’em?” he asked in
surprised accents. “Come, this is good,
don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>He spoke with the assurance of an old
friend, and the girl, who had entered the
carriage with him, was seized with a sudden
horror lest the other occupants of the
compartment should identify her with this
stranger.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my eyes ache when I read in
the train,” answered she, searching about for
some plausible excuse.</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s a pity, they’re much too pretty
for that,” responded he with intended
gallantry.</p>

<p>Her eyes swam in a mist of tears. A less
diffident girl would have instinctively known
how to rebuke the offender, but she was
accustomed to think humbly of herself, and at
once concluded that something in her own
conduct had led the man to think that he
might take liberties with her. Suddenly, to
her intense vexation, a large tear splashed on
her lap; but at the critical moment, a voice
said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but I believe you would like a
window seat. It is so much more comfortable.
See, let me move your things.”</p>

<p>In another moment, the speaker, who had
been sitting beside her, and next to the window,
had changed places with her, and had moved
her bag and rugs so as to make a comfortable
barrier round her. She tried to thank him,
and met the eyes of a young lady to whom he
had been talking and who, she supposed, must
be his wife.</p>

<p>“You are very tired, I am sure,” said the
latter. “Granville, pass me my bag. Now,
do have a little milk, it will be so good
for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, but I really do not
need it,” protested the girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, you don’t know what is
good for you! Come, I insist on it!”</p>

<p>So she swallowed the milk mechanically,
and then went on looking out of the window,
inwardly struggling between gratitude to the
unknown lady and embarrassment at having
her confusion noticed. She was angry with
herself too. She had felt so perfectly competent
to undertake this expedition&mdash;a High
School mistress, living in rooms, she was
accustomed to look after herself&mdash;and here
was she, Catherine West, who had taken a
high class at Cambridge, actually crying
because an under-bred man had annoyed her!
But the truth was that she knew very little of
the world. She had gone straight from
school to college, straight from college to the
post that she now held. She had thought
little of men or of their relations to her, for
women, whose youth is absorbed in intellectual
interests, are later in development on
the emotional side than others, yet, when the
awakening comes, are apt, perhaps because of
the severity of their early training, to feel more
strongly and to suffer more deeply.</p>

<p>The journey passed without further incident.
One by one, as evening came on, the passengers
settled themselves, comfortably or
uncomfortably, against air-cushions or feather
pillows, and fell asleep. But sleep was a long
time coming to Catherine; she closed her
eyes, but her excitement kept her awake, and
when at last she fell into an uneasy doze, it
was only to rouse at every station, where the
train drew up with a jerk and scream, and to
stare bewildered at the red lights that flashed
across the darkness.</p>

<p>Morning at last, and the frontier reached!
Catherine thought that she would never forget
the breath of cool clear air that swept through
the close compartment like a cleansing touch.
The occupants, dishevelled and unwashed,
rushed out for coffee and rolls, then back
again, and the train went steaming on through
the early coolness of the Swiss dawn, while
Catherine watched the east growing rosy
behind the pines that fringed the hills, and
then, in one rapturous moment, caught sight
of the first snowy peak, all hushed and
stainless in the silence of the morning.</p>

<p>Suddenly her glance met that of the lady
opposite.</p>

<p>“How beautiful!” they both exclaimed in
one breath.</p>

<p>From that moment the compact of friendship
was sealed between the two women;
they began to talk to one another, and found
that they had many interests in common. So
the time passed pleasantly, till, arrived at
length at their destination, they found that
they were going to the same hotel.</p>

<p>“Give my brother”&mdash;Catherine started at
this revelation&mdash;“the ticket for your luggage,
and he will see after it for you,” said
her friend. “You and I will go on to the
hotel. Oh, the delight of a wash! And
then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then something to eat would be advisable,”
said her brother, who, having
despatched the luggage in the hotel omnibus,
now caught them up.</p>

<p>His words came as a shock to Catherine.
“Fancy thinking of that when he has the
mountains to look at!” Her opinion of
masculine nature, which was chiefly based on
an intimate acquaintance with the poetry of
Shelley, went down a hundred degrees.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more she found herself in
the little bare room allotted to her, where the
furniture was of the simplest and the cleanliness
complete. She felt herself, in her dusty
dress, a stain on its exquisite purity. She
rushed to her portmanteau and opened it.</p>

<p>“It is extravagant, I know, but I can’t help
it!” And she shook out of its folds a white
muslin dress that had hitherto been sacred to
“functions” and festivals. And as she
arrayed herself in it before the glass the
conviction came to her that she really looked
very nice. Was she growing vain, she
wondered, or why was it that she felt such a
sudden interest in her appearance?</p>

<p>She left her room and came timidly down
the corridor. Now that she was alone in this
big hotel, a certain fear came over her. She
had boasted to herself that she was able to
take care of herself; she had had no compunctions
in coming alone on this expedition;
of course she would have preferred to have a
companion, but since all her efforts to obtain
one had been unavailing, she had determined
not to be disappointed of the anticipated
pleasure, and had, therefore, come alone.
But now she felt almost sorry that she had
done so; however innocent her intention, she
felt that she had laid herself open to misconstruction;
her experience on the journey had
told her that.</p>

<p>“My sister has sent me to see if I could
find you,” said a voice beside her. “The
dining-room is this way. She has kept a seat
for you&mdash;unless, of course, you prefer to sit
somewhere else.” The tone was rather constrained,
as if the speaker had been party to
an arrangement of which he did not altogether
approve. Inwardly he was thinking, “She
seems a nice girl enough, and is certainly very
pretty, but I wish Margaret would not rush
into these impulsive friendships.”</p>

<p>Catherine felt the coldness, and was glad to
sink into the chair that he placed for her.
His sister sat between them, and bravely tried
to keep up a conversation. But Catherine
was subdued and nervous, and her brother
was silent and restrained.</p>

<p>Nobody was sorry when dinner was over,
and Margaret and Catherine strolled into the
verandah. The days were already drawing in,
and it was nearly dark, but a slender moon
hung between the two snowy peaks that
guarded the valley, and in their ears was the
murmur of a torrent, that, slipping from the
icy embrace of the mountains, rushed impetuously
from the glacier that was wedged
between them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MENDING THE QUILT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“And now let us produce our credentials,”
said her new friend. “I am Margaret Gray.
I live by my wits, namely journalism; that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650">{650}</a></span>
I write ‘Answers to Correspondents’ for half-a-dozen
ladies’ papers. My brother is also
engaged in the pursuit of letters. He is, in
fact, Lord Mayne’s private secretary. He is
very clever, as all brothers ought to be, and
took a First in Greats. He is to marry, of
course, an heiress, and go into Parliament, and
make a name for himself and the family, the
family being at present comprehended by
himself and me. Finally, we are too poor at
present to think of heiresses or even to
approach the only available one, having piles
of other people’s debts to pay off. Now for
yours.”</p>

<p>Catherine told her simply and frankly all
her short history. How, left an orphan, with
just sufficient money to pay for her education,
she had been brought up at an endowed
school, and had then won a scholarship to
Cambridge, and how, on leaving college, she
had found a post in a High School in a large
manufacturing town, where she lived by
herself in rooms. She had only been there a
short time, and did not know many people;
there were so few people that she could know,
except the other mistresses, living for the most
part alone or sharing rooms together. It was
less by what she was told than by her quick
imagination, aided by her knowledge of other
professional women, that Margaret was able
to conjure up to herself the long harassing
days, the physical fatigue that could seldom
find relief, and then the solitary evenings in a
dreary lodging-house. She contrasted it with
her own life spent in London, among interesting
people, and full of change and movement.
Certainly she worked hard, but the possession
of some private means and the knowledge
that her future was comfortably provided for
took away the anxiety that haunts the working
days of so many women. Her heart went
out in sympathy to this girl, who hardly
realised as yet the whole significance of her
position.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dreadfully monotonous sometimes?
Don’t you long to get away?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I feel as if I could endure it
no longer, especially in the evening, when I
have finished my corrections and am too tired
even to read. But then there are the children,
and children are so delightful; though at the
end of the term I do feel as if I never wanted
to see another child all my life. But that
feeling soon wears off; they are so innocent
and fascinating, and never mind showing what
they think. Oh, yes; of course it is only the
children who make things bearable.”</p>

<p>“Now I can understand the apparent
absurdity of a girl like you rushing off on a
Swiss tour by yourself. Even I, who am several
years older, and have much more knowledge
of the world, and no pretension to beauty,
should hesitate about such a thing. Did it
never strike you that people might misunderstand
you, that you were laying yourself out
to be misunderstood?”</p>

<p>“Never! Why should it? I did not
think the world so cruel. Must we wait till
we are too old to enjoy things, from fear of
what people will say? In twenty years I
shall be too old to climb mountains and travel
cheaply. Then it will be quite proper, I
suppose, but quite impossible.”</p>

<p>There was a touch of bitterness in her tone
that threw a new light on her character to
Margaret.</p>

<p>“The world is hard on us women,” she
answered gently. “We are in a transition
state at present. Only the most enlightened
and sympathetic men understand the independent
woman. The very fact of her
independence makes her a prey to men like
that cad in the railway carriage, or quite
incomprehensible to chivalrous men like my
brother. You understand; he would do
anything to help you out of a difficulty, but
would not understand your preference for all
the perils of a solitary tour over the security
and boredom of those dreadful lodgings.
Most men still prefer the clinging trustful girl
who claims their protection at every other
step. She makes them so conscious of their
own superior power. But the woman who
strikes out for herself and asserts her own
individuality is a challenge to the cad and an
unknown quantity to most men of honour.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that we can only suffer and
wait for better things.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Sometimes I think we are suffering
vicariously for the good of generations of
unborn women. If we maintain the right of
women to live independently and to think for
themselves, a future age will concede it as a
matter of course. And yet one must be very
sure of oneself to take up that independent
stand. Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand,” answered
Catherine.</p>

<p>“Only this, dear”&mdash;there was a lingering,
protective stress on the last word that appealed
to the lonely girl&mdash;“you seem to me one of
those women who are independent by circumstance
rather than by choice. One of those
who proclaim aloud their independence at
twenty and at thirty wail privately for the
dependence they appear to scorn. One of
those, in fact, who would seem more in her
place with her foot on a cradle rocker than
rushing over Europe accompanied only by a
travelling trunk and a green ticket case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are mistaken, quite mistaken,”
cried Catherine&mdash;“quite mistaken. I am not
that kind of woman at all. And besides, if I
were, what would be the good? Surely I am
happier struggling by myself than making
myself miserable over some man; for I can
never marry, you know.”</p>

<p>“Never marry? But why?”</p>

<p>“I am so poor, and the only kind of man
that I could think of would never look at an
insignificant person like me. No, I shall
never marry; and that being so, I would
rather school myself to independence.”</p>

<p>“You goose! How little you know of
men. But I can assure you that till you have
made yourself miserable&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;over
some man, you will be an incomplete and, so
far, an ineffective character.”</p>

<p>Catherine was unconscious of what Margaret’s
intuition led her to suspect, namely,
that her conviction of insignificance and
renewed enthusiasm for independence were
due to Mr. Gray’s polite indifference at dinner.
He now joined them, and Catherine immediately
said “Good night” and disappeared.
She did not know that his eyes were following
her slim white figure as it disappeared between
the festoons of Virginia creeper that draped
the verandah.</p>

<p>“Don’t lecture me!” cried Margaret when
she had gone. “I know what you are going
to say.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked her brother, raising his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Oh, that I am too impulsive and all that,
and that I shall get into trouble some day by
making friends of unknown strangers, who
may turn out after all to be disreputable
actresses or anarchists in disguise.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! But really, Margaret, you
can never tell; all sorts of people come to
these hotels.”</p>

<p>“Just as if I didn’t know that! Ah,
my dear Granville, you may be very clever;
your head is full of classics and politics, and
things I don’t know anything about, but
you’ve ‘no art to find the mind’s construction
in the face,’ and that is just what I have.
Now, can you say you have ever known me
wrong in my estimate of people?”</p>

<p>“Not so far, certainly. But doesn’t it
strike you as a little odd that so young a girl
should be running about the country by
herself?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” and Margaret poured out
Catherine’s story. “Poor little thing! She
is terribly lonely. You and I must do our
best to look after her, and give her a good
time while we are here.”</p>

<p>Now this was a very heroic and unselfish
resolution on Margaret’s part, for she did not
often get her brother to herself, and this
holiday had been anticipated with all the
more pleasure on that account.</p>

<p>“As you will,” he said. “I will do my
best to please you. I only hope that your
charity may not be blinding your judgment.
You are the only woman I know who is
absurdly susceptible to beauty in her own sex.”</p>

<p>“Susceptible to beauty!” cried Margaret,
with laughing eyes. “Just as if I should
have noticed her at all if you had not made
her change places with you. After all, Granville,
you see it was you who began the
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“How absurd! Any fellow would have
done that. Didn’t you see that she was on
the point of tears?”</p>

<p>Margaret smiled wisely.</p>

<p>“Oh, you noticed that, too? And yet you
suspect her genuineness. Now, do you think
that any girl who wasn’t nice would let an
incident like that trouble her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I give it up. I daresay you are
right. At any rate I will do my best for your
<i>protégée</i>!”</p>

<p>“Mine? Remember your responsibilities,”
she answered, and so they parted for the
night.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> F. W. L. SLADEN.</p>


<h3>PART III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the combs get drawn out and filled with
brood and honey, more room will be required
by the swarm in the hive. This may at first
be given by putting fresh frames fitted with
foundation into the stock-box. When the
stock-box is quite filled with frames and bees,
and still more room is required, it will be time
to think of putting on the surplus honey-chamber,
or <i>super</i>.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of super, the <i>rack of
sections</i>, and the <i>box of shallow frames</i>.</p>

<p>The bee-keeper who wishes to work for
honey-in-the-comb uses the rack of sections.
This consists of a light wooden rack, usually
made to contain twenty-one little wooden
boxes called <i>sections</i>, each of which when
finished by the bees will contain about one
pound of honey-comb (E in the illustration).
The section (A) is cleverly cut from one strip
of wood, which has three V-shaped cuts across
it to form the corners, and is dovetailed at
each end, so that it can be folded up very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_651">{651}</a></span>
easily by the bee-keeper, something after the
style of the outer case of a match-box. In
the figure are shown a section in the flat and
the same when folded (A, B).</p>

<div class="figcenter w300">
<img src="images/i_651a.jpg" width="300" height="217" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE EVOLUTION OF A SECTION OF HONEY-COMB.</p>

<p class="center">
B, C.&mdash;The work of the bee-keeper.<br />
D, E.&mdash;The work of the bees in the hive.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A starter of comb-foundation is as necessary
for sections as it is for frames, otherwise the
bees might build the honey-comb across the
sections, joining them all together, and
necessitating cutting the combs to get them
apart. For this purpose a saw cut is generally
made in the top bar of each section in which a
strip of a specially thin description of foundation,
called super foundation, is inserted (C).</p>

<p>The sections are placed in the section-rack
in seven rows, each row consisting of three
sections. Between each row a thin sheet of
tin or wood, called a <i>separator</i>, is placed.
The object of the separators is to ensure the
face of the combs being flat, the bees leaving
a uniform space of about a quarter of an inch
between the separator and the face of the
comb. The sections are held in place by
means of a dummy-board and spring at the
end of the last row.</p>

<p>The rack of sections is now ready to be
placed upon the stock-box. You will notice
that openings are cut in the edges of the top
and bottom bars of the sections. The openings
in the bottom bar are to enable the bees
to gain access to the sections from the frames
below. Often the end bars are similarly cut;
when this is so the bees can travel from
section to section in the rack.</p>

<div class="figcenter w350">
<img src="images/i_651b.jpg" width="350" height="267" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">RACK OF SECTIONS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To prevent the queen bee from going up
into the super to deposit eggs in the combs
which are intended to receive honey only, it
will be necessary to place a <i>queen-excluder</i>
between the stock-box
and the rack of sections. The
queen-excluder is a sheet of zinc
which is perforated all over with
holes; these are large enough to
admit the workers, but just too
small to let the queen pass
through.</p>

<p>Choose a fine warm day for
putting on the super. Midday,
when the bees are flying freely, is
the best time for the operation.</p>

<p>I will suppose that this is the
occasion of the beginner’s first
attempt at examining the interior
of the hive, and will therefore go
into the method of procedure
somewhat fully.</p>

<p>Several articles will be necessary.</p>

<p>The bee-veil will, of course, be
worn on this occasion. A screwdriver
may be useful for prizing
up the ends of the frames, the bees having a
habit of fastening down everything inside the
hive with a sticky substance called
propolis, which they collect from the
buds of certain trees and plants.
This substance is used more freely
by the bees towards the close of the
summer than at present.</p>

<p>The most useful appliance employed
by the bee-keeper is unquestionably
the smoker, for by its means
the bees can be quieted and put into
such a condition that almost anything
can be done to them. Smoke
for the bees might be compared to
the anæsthetic of the surgeon, but it
is not intended to stupefy them.
Experience and judgment are required
in using the smoker, and perfection
cannot be attained at once.
A few directions, however, will be
useful.</p>

<p>It is very important that the smoker
be charged with smouldering material
that will not go out as long as it is
wanted. The best fuel is perhaps a
strip of brown paper rolled up loosely
in the form of a cartridge, so that
the air may have free circulation through it,
but see that the brown paper is of the right
kind, as some sorts are almost sure to go out
in a few minutes’ time, while others again are
equally liable to burst out into flame. Dry
touchwood makes very good fuel for the
smoker, seldom going out when once well
alight. Old rags, dried fungus, etc., are
also said to be useful,
but on no account
use any strong
or poisonous smoke,
such as would be
produced by burning
tobacco or sulphur.
When not being
used, the lighted
smoker should be
stood upright, in the
position shown in
the figure (see last
paper); this will help
to keep it alight by
the better circulation
of air.</p>

<p>The object of the
smoker is to quiet,
not to stupefy, the
bees; it should not
therefore be used too
freely. After the
roof of the hive has
been removed, a few
light puffs of smoke
may be given under
the edges of the quilts, and perhaps another
in the entrance, the bees often replying by a
deep low hum. Now wait a minute or two,
so that the bees may prepare for the operation
by gorging themselves with some of the newly-gathered
honey, and then, having got them
into a good temper, we may commence work
without delay.</p>

<p>If we wish to ascertain the condition of the
bees, we may lift a frame gently out of the
hive, examine it, and then replace it speedily
so that the brood shall not get chilled, care
being taken not to crush any bees in so doing.</p>

<p>The bees may now begin to show signs of
restlessness, “boiling over” the tops of the
frames. This must be checked by the administration
of a few more puffs of smoke.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SHEET OF QUEEN-EXCLUDING ZINC.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If, as the result of our investigation, we
have found that the colony is in an advanced
enough state to make use of the super, the
quilts must be removed, and the sheet of
queen-excluding zinc laid over the frame in
place of them. The rack of sections will then
be placed on the queen-excluder, the quilts
being now transferred to the top of the
sections. If the rack of sections does not
quite cover the tops of the frames in the stock-box,
any spaces that are left round the sides
should be covered over with strips of stout
cloth. The operation is then completed by
putting on the lift and roof.</p>

<p>In doing bee-work like the above, care
must be taken not to jar the hive. Bees do
not like vibration of any kind, and nothing upsets
them so easily as rough handling.</p>

<p>Never open the hive with no definite object
in view, except just to see how the bees are
“getting on,” but make up your mind beforehand
what has to be ascertained or done, and
then carry it out as promptly and effectively
as you can, closing up the hive as soon as your
object has been accomplished. Things that
should always be noted in opening a hive are
(1) the presence of plenty of food in the shape
of sealed or unsealed honey, and (2) the
presence of healthy brood in all stages,
including eggs; these last, owing to their
small size, will require a little looking for at
first. If some of the brood appears to be
rotting, emitting a more or less foul smell,
your bees have contracted a serious infectious
disease which, to be successfully dealt with,
requires the immediate assistance of a competent
expert. This disease is known as “foul
brood,” and it is now sadly prevalent in many
parts of this country, owing chiefly to the lack
of effort on the part of careless bee-keepers in
stamping it out. The symptoms and treatment
of foul brood will be described in a later
paper.</p>

<p>Do not let an accidental sting or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652">{652}</a></span>
interfere with your work; the pain will go off
in a minute or two, but in cases where the
whole colony is allowed to get into an irritated
state, the only way of reducing it to order will
be to leave the work in hand and subjugate
them with repeated smoking, but this is hardly
good advice to the beginner.</p>

<p>I know of no really effective remedy for bee-stings.
Many things are recommended as
being more or less beneficial, such as blue-bag,
dock-leaf, the juice of the fig-tree, etc. The
best thing to do is to extract the sting at once
with the poison-bag attached, taking care not
to compress the latter, and then apply a little
strong liquid ammonia; this will have the
effect of somewhat neutralising the poison,
which is acid. Sucking the spot before the
poison has time to disseminate itself in the
blood, does good. These measures, if taken
promptly, will considerably alleviate the unpleasant
after-effects of swelling and irritation
which sometimes follow. The poison contained
in the bee-sting does not seem to be
really harmful to the system; the chief danger
seems to be in excessive swelling, but such
cases are so rare that the beginner has no
ground for apprehension.</p>

<p>Though most people like sections of comb-honey,
some prefer to have the extracted
honey, which, when put up in bottles or jars,
is a more convenient article for winter use.</p>

<p>In former times the only way of separating
the honey from the comb was by cutting the
honeycomb up and letting it drain through a
canvas-strainer in a warm temperature. This
process is apt to be a messy and tedious one,
and the honey produced by it is more or less
deep in colour from the large amount of pollen
that it contains.</p>

<p>Nowadays, thanks to the invention of the
<i>honey-extractor</i>, we may extract the pure,
clear honey from the comb without having to
cut it up, and the same frame of comb may be
returned to the bees again and again, to be
repeatedly refilled with honey, thus saving the
bees a large amount of labour in comb-building.
The details and working of the honey-extractor
will be fully described in the next paper.</p>

<p>Frames of comb intended for extracting are
usually not so deep as the ordinary standard
frames in the stock-box: they are then called
<i>shallow frames</i>, and the super containing
them is called a <i>shallow-frame box</i>. The
shallow-frame box is made like the stock-box,
and contains generally ten shallow frames
fitted with metal ends. Each frame must, of
course, be fitted with at least a starter of
comb-foundation, and in placing the box of
shallow frames on the hive, a sheet of queen-excluding
zinc should be placed under it, as
with the rack of sections.</p>

<p>Those who are going to use shallow frames
will also now need to procure a honey-extractor.
A good extractor costs from eighteen to
thirty shillings.</p>

<p>Often a colony is strong enough to take two
supers at one time, one under the other. In
this case the second one should be placed
underneath the first, after the latter has been
on the hive for about a week. A rack of
sections may be used with a box of shallow
frames, or two racks of sections and two boxes
of shallow frames may be used instead, if
desired. A swarm like the one I am
describing is, however, very seldom able to fill
two supers at once during its first year, because
it does not commence work until a part of the
season has passed, and the stock-box has to be
filled before work can be undertaken in earnest
in the supers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class="ph3">A MASCULINE STANDPOINT.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">You</span> needn’t go into raptures of
gratitude till you hear all about my
suggestion, my love,” said Mrs. Bray;
“it’s not all advantage. In fact the
person concerned has been rather on my
mind, because I wasn’t at all sure it
would be easy to find her a situation in
what she calls ‘this Babylon.’”</p>

<p>“Please tell me about her,” pleaded
Lucy.</p>

<p>“To begin with, she is nearly forty
years old.”</p>

<p>Lucy at once thought of “Mrs.
Morison,” but what she said was, “I
think that is an advantage with me
if she has been a good woman and&mdash;is
sober.”</p>

<p>“A good woman? My love, she’s
one of the unco’ guid! And she’s a
total abstainer&mdash;always has been. But
she is not what one can call a trained
servant. She has not been in a situation
for about twenty years.”</p>

<p>“What has she been doing?” Lucy
asked.</p>

<p>“Keeping her father’s house and
looking after him,” answered Mrs. Bray,
“and now he’s dead. He had a little
farm&mdash;a croft, I think they call it&mdash;over
the hills and far away, somewhere in a
Highland place, which, because it is not
an island, is called the Black Isle.”</p>

<p>The quick, sympathetic old lady
caught and understood an expression
which flitted over Lucy’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all quite genuine,” she
said; “that is its one clear advantage.
She’s a friend of my poor Rachel’s&mdash;at
least, Rachel has known all about her
and ‘her folks’ for years and years.
Her brother was piper in the same
regiment with Rachel’s lover. And
when Rachel went North to see that
lover’s mother, after he had gone to
India, she was in this woman’s house,
and Rachel says that it was most
beautifully kept, and that there were no
people in the place more respected than
these Gillespies.”</p>

<p>“One wonders why she left her native
place and came so far away,” observed
Lucy.</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head knowingly,
and replied, “As poor Rachel says,
‘there are wheels within wheels.’ It
seems there is a married brother with
his wife living near the ‘croft,’ and I
understand there was no love lost between
this woman and her sister-in-law. There
was some sort of love-affair mixed up in
their animosity. Rachel put me to
sleep one afternoon telling me about it,
so you won’t expect me to remember
details. And when the father died,
the home had to be broken up anyhow,
for the daughter had nothing to live on.
I fancy she didn’t care to go to service
within the range of the sister-in-law,
‘mistress in her own house.’ There’s a
deal of human nature in man, my dear,
and especially in woman. Rachel says
her friend doesn’t want to go back, but
if she doesn’t get a place soon, she’s
getting so low spirited that she thinks
she will,” continued Mrs. Bray. “You
see she has, after all, only a servant’s
recommendation&mdash;Rachel’s&mdash;and that
wouldn’t mean much to many, but
it may to you, who have known Rachel
in my house for so many years, and
who understand how faithful and good
she is, poor, silly, sentimental thing.”</p>

<p>Lucy looked up quickly into her old
friend’s face. “I would take your
Rachel’s recommendation quite as soon
as a ‘character’ from any mistress,”
she said.</p>

<p>“I think you would be wise to do so,”
replied Mrs. Bray. “This woman will
be clean and honest, certainly not likely
to attract any troublesome flirtations.
She’s got the soft Highland voice with a
pretty little whine in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, call it a wail!” said Lucy,
laughing.</p>

<p>“She’s terribly solemn to look at, and
she ends her speeches with a sigh,”
went on Mrs. Bray. “But she’s not
bad-looking, and is of quite superior
appearance. Her name is rather a
mouthful&mdash;Clementina Gillespie&mdash;and
she’s not a person whom one could
reasonably shorten into Clem or Tina.
No&mdash;it wouldn’t do. You might as well
call Robert the Bruce&mdash;Bob!”</p>

<p>“Will you send her to see me?”
asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” said the old lady. “That
ridiculous Rachel will be so pleased!
It seems a comfort to her to think of
having her dead lover’s dead old friend’s
sister to live near her. To me it seems
a far-off cry of consolation! But everyone
to their taste. And now, at last,
we’ll dismiss the kitchen, and you must
tell me all about Mr. Challoner.”</p>

<p>Lucy had not only her good news to
relate, but she actually had something
to show. The <i>Slains Castle</i> had
stayed for a few days at a certain port,
and Charlie had sat for a photograph,
which he sent home in his letter. It
might not be much as a work of art or
science, for the posing was all wrong
and the chemicals were manifestly bad.
Yet next to Hugh himself it was the
very dearest thing in Lucy’s present
possession, so satisfactory was its
assurance of the beloved wanderer’s
renewed strength and energy. Where
were the wasted form and the wan
countenance which had hitherto haunted
Lucy’s memories of her husband? They
had vanished, and thus the poor little
photograph had cheered Lucy as not even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_653">{653}</a></span>
Charlie’s letters had done. For in those
he might have been trying “to make
the best of things”&mdash;to dwell on every
trifling improvement, so as to cheer and
uphold her in her loneliness. That fear
had often haunted her, basing itself on
her own silence concerning Pollie’s defection,
which silence she had kept
intact, “for fear of worrying him.” The
shock which Mrs. Morison’s breakdown
had given her, when on the
eve of revelation, had restrained her
from any further attempt at confidence
on this matter. This reticence and its
motive naturally made her dread some
corresponding reticence on her husband’s
part. The little portrait set that
suspicion at rest. So it had its place in
the centre of the dining-room mantelshelf,
and was provided with a dainty
little frame&mdash;the only “article of luxury”
which Lucy had bought since Charlie’s
departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bray went off gratified and elate.
She loved to play the part of fairy godmother,
though when she was defeated
in that&mdash;as when the death of Rachel’s
lover prevented her from overwhelming
her maid with marriage gifts&mdash;she was
apt to turn unsympathetic and cynical.
She prolonged her visit to the little
house with the verandah and had to
give up two or three other calls she had
arranged in the same neighbourhood.
She drove off saying to herself with a
full consciousness of the humour of the
reflection&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now I feel good; I could be always
good if I was in a world of good people
and was able to straighten out every
tangle I saw.”</p>

<p>Lucy had another visitor that evening,
Tom Black, who had never failed to put
in his appearance from time to time
ever since that memorable Christmas
Day. Tom’s visits were generally of a
most cheerful not to say hilarious
description, beginning with games of
romps with Hugh and ending in all
sorts of little services to Lucy herself.
Thanks to his aid, she had really given
all her books their spring dusting and
had got them correctly restored to their
proper places&mdash;a thing which could not
have been done by Jane, who though
perfectly able to read, would have stood
them upside down, and scattered “sets”
most recklessly. Tom always asked
whether there was “anything going on
that he could do?” and Lucy answered
him frankly and candidly. She wondered
sometimes whether the inquiry came
from humility or pride&mdash;from an unnecessarily
humble feeling that his presence
might be less than pleasure unless it
was useful, or from a proud masculine
consciousness that a feminine household
may often stand in need of a strong arm
and a steady hand.</p>

<p>But this evening Tom was in such
doleful dumps that Lucy was quite glad
that her own spirits had been somewhat
cheered by Mrs. Bray’s visit.</p>

<p>Tom had got to leave his lodgings.
He had been placed, on his first arrival
in London, with the elderly widow of a
clerk in Mr. Challoner’s firm. She had
a neat little seven-roomed house somewhere
in Barnsbury, and she let two of
her bedrooms and one parlour to Tom
Black and another young man. It was
a quiet and comfortable though unpretentious
home, wherein a youth who was
inclined to good habits found every
influence to help his perseverance therein.
Youths who were not inclined to
good habits were not allowed to linger
there. In her earlier and more vigorous
days the worthy landlady had wrestled
hard with sundry ill-doers, and not without
a certain sort of success, though she
herself was more inclined to regard
the results with cynicism and suspicion
than with self-satisfaction. When neighbours
would say to her how proud she
must be that So-and-so had profited
by her warnings, disciplines, and encouragements,
she was wont to say
“that he was different from what he
once was, but she wasn’t so sure that
he was any better.” Being a Scots
woman herself she would tell the story
of the Scots minister who was of the
opinion that the sight of one’s “converts”
was generally calculated “to
keep one humble.”</p>

<p>Of late years, however, she had ceased
to struggle with those who inclined to
do evil, and had reserved herself for
the upholding of those who meant to
do well.</p>

<p>“I’ve had my time of keeping a
reformatory,” she had said in her quaint
way, “now somebody else must take
a turn!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mott is giving up housekeeping
altogether now, Mrs. Challoner,”
Tom explained with a rueful countenance.
“She’s got a tenant for the whole
house, and she’s going to live in the
country in some little place which she
can manage alone. She says she is
‘weary of her life because of those
daughters of Heth’&mdash;meaning the servant
girls. You know the way she
speaks, Mrs. Challoner.”</p>

<p>Lucy laughed. She knew Mrs. Mott
very well, and she was beginning to
realise the difficulties which must beset
such a person.</p>

<p>“I sympathise with her,” she said.
“But surely many of her servants must
have been models! I thought the house
always looked so bright and pleasant.”</p>

<p>“She says that’s because she put
herself into it,” explained Tom. “Just
whatever they left undone, she says, she
did, and she did it all, when they ran
away or gave her notice and went off
before she had got another. Now she
says she can’t do so any more; she’s
near sixty, and her feet are weak, and
she can’t manage the stairs, and she
won’t keep people in her house if it can’t
be kept as it should be. I’m sure she
might let her place go very different from
what it is, and yet it would be a palace
of neatness compared with the houses
which I’ve seen since I’ve been looking
for lodgings,” added poor Tom ruefully.</p>

<p>“Has she had any special trouble
lately?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“She says that for the last three years
she has only had one girl who was
respectable and willing to learn, and
she attended some class or guild
where the ladies told her she was
‘too good for domestic service’ and
took her off to be trained as a hospital
nurse,” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear!” said Lucy, “as if
the work of prevention is not far better
and more honourable than that of mere
cure. And it ought to be more honoured!”</p>

<p>“We have had some very queer
customers lately, I must say,” Tom went
on in his blunt boyish way. “Young
Hinton&mdash;that’s the other fellow who
stays at Mrs. Mott’s&mdash;happened to have
a good deal of note-paper and some
hundreds of envelopes marked with a
handsome H. Well, he never could
understand how that paper went off so
quickly. He would take out a packet,
and write a few letters, and then the
next time he went to write he would find
the packet almost empty. He used to
say it was bewitched! Well, Mrs. Mott
caught that servant in the act of stealing
something&mdash;I think it was taking out
coal in the big basket she carried to
fetch potatoes. When Mrs. Mott counted
over her other things she found some
towels missing. So she told the girl
she had better open her box and show
what else she had, and there, along with
the towels, were heaps of Hinton’s paper
and envelopes, and what was funniest of
all, an old album of his with a lot of half-faded
photos of his aunts and cousins.
Now what could she have wanted with
that? The paper, of course, she meant
to use, because her name was Hannah&mdash;an
H, you see.”</p>

<p>“The stolen photographs make the
story look like a genuine case of
kleptomania,” observed Lucy; “yet it
may have had some object which does
not readily occur to us. She may have
wished to lay claim to relationship with
some nice respectable-looking people,
such as Mr. Hinton’s friends doubtless
were.”</p>

<p>“That was what Hinton said,” Tom
returned. “He found out Hannah had
been a workhouse child, and didn’t
know of anybody belonging to her. It
did seem pathetic in a way. Hinton
thought so. He wrote to his grandmother
in the country and got her to
take the girl and give her another chance.
But she soon ran away. Some gipsy
show-people had been in the town, and
the police said she went off with them.
They had seen her among them.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought Lucy, “and who
knows what thread of hereditary lawlessness
and vagabondage had been in
this poor girl, whose childhood nobody
had been at pains to understand and to
discipline? And yet how impossible it
is that such a one could be harboured
in a house like Mrs. Mott’s&mdash;nay, it
would be wrong, for nobody must voluntarily
assume responsibilities which clash
with duties.”</p>

<p>“What decided Mrs. Mott, though,”
Tom went on, “was when her last girl
calmly took a candle to see where
the gas was escaping. Mrs. Mott
just stepped out of the parlour in time
to see her coming with it, alight, out of
the pantry. The gas escape was in the
kitchen, and she was on her way downstairs.
If Mrs. Mott had stayed in the
parlour, we should have been all blown
up together, for I was in the room overhead.
Mrs. Mott was dreadfully upset;
she set open every door and window and
then called me. I turned off the gas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654">{654}</a></span>
and soon found the leakage. Mrs. Mott
was quite ill with the shock of knowing
what might have happened. She said
to me, at once, that she couldn’t stand it
any more, she could not bear the responsibilities
that the irresponsible might
bring down on her head at any moment.
I thought the feeling might pass off
with the fright; but she’s stuck to it&mdash;more’s
the pity for me.”</p>

<p>“One wonders at city girls not having
yet learned the truth about gas,” said
Lucy. “Certainly I have heard curious
stories about country people coming into
town and ‘blowing out’ the light, and
wondering much at the ‘nasty smell’
which ensued, compelling them to open
the window, though there might be frost
and snow outside. Did this girl come
from the country?”</p>

<p>“Not she,” said Tom; “she belongs
to a mews quite close to our place. And
what is more, on our kitchen wall there
is a printed placard giving full instructions
about such household matters
as breaking pipes, escaping gas, or
street doors left ajar.”</p>

<p>“Everybody can read nowadays,”
observed Lucy, “but every now and
then one comes across a person who
does not seem to read with any ease
or facility; perhaps she was one of
these.”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. “No,” he said.
“Mrs. Mott told me that till that day
she had never had much fault to find
with her (she’d only been with us for
about three weeks), but that she had
been sorry to see that she spent all
her leisure in reading penny papers,
with stories and pictures of men in
evening dress and women with trailing
robes, all dukes and viscountesses, and
pretty girls in shops. She must have
spent threepence or fourpence a week
on these, Mrs. Mott says, and when she
had read them, she tore them up or burnt
them. Mrs. Mott had told her she
ought to settle to one good magazine
and collect a nice stock for bound
volumes.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder Mrs. Mott is rather
sick of it,” Tom went on, “only I wish
she didn’t give up out of feeling so
responsible for us. All that we shall
gain, as it seems to me, is, most likely,
girls quite as irresponsible, and a landlady
equally so. Mrs. Mott’s charges
have been very moderate&mdash;I did not
realise how moderate&mdash;till I have gone
about and seen what is offered for the
same money.”</p>

<p>“Then you have begun to make
inquiries,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“Ay,” answered Tom, rather bitterly,
“and I don’t know when I shall leave
off or where I shall find myself. I
mustn’t go one bit further from the office
than Mrs. Mott’s house is. Indeed,
that’s rather too far, except that I was
there from the first, and knew when
I was comfortable. I’ve spoilt two
Saturday afternoons going round and
asking questions at every house where I
saw ‘Furnished Apartments.’ And oh,
Mrs. Challoner!”&mdash;Tom broke off with
an indescribably comic expression of
dismay on his good-humoured face.</p>

<p>“Did you have some funny experiences?”
Lucy questioned.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I?” echoed Tom. “The
very first place to which I went was in
a good street not very far from the office,
and the house looked nice on the outside.
The door was opened by such a girl!&mdash;I
don’t know whether she belonged to
the family, or was a servant&mdash;I should
think the former. But she might have
been a Fuzzy Wuzzy straight from the
Soudan by the look of her hair. It stood
straight up all round her head. You
couldn’t believe it unless you saw it!
And her gown might have been made
of dirty dishcloths. The passage looked
like a black cavern. I didn’t want to
go in, but I didn’t know how to get
away. So I asked some questions. I
said I wanted a bedroom-sitting-room,
and the use of a parlour for meals. She
said, ‘There wasn’t no parlour; their
gentlemen mostly took their meals out.’
That gave me excuse to say it wouldn’t
suit, and I got away.”</p>

<p>“Surely that must be a very extravagant
arrangement for the gentlemen,”
said Lucy.</p>

<p>“Mustn’t it?” rejoined Tom. “I
should be stone-broke in a month! But
I found that was the cry at all of them.
The best&mdash;the most decent-looking&mdash;would
give you your breakfast and
‘something at night, if you wanted it.’
That last was quite a concession. But
they all turned up their noses at the
thought of dinners! ‘There were
plenty of restaurants,’ they said, ‘and
they were cheap enough.’</p>

<p>“And the rooms!” continued Tom,
with his disgusted voice. “Those which
I could have for my price were always
at the back, with a brick wall within an
arm’s length from the window. And,
ugh! there was a feeling about them as
if one could smell and taste all the
fellows who had ever used them! Lots
of the bedrooms had nailed-down carpets,
whose very pattern had disappeared.
And the curtains and chair-covers looked
as if they had not been washed since
they were made.”</p>

<p>“I daresay they were not washable,”
explained Lucy. “Cretonnes have replaced
dimities and chintz, and none
but the very best cretonnes will bear
washing. This is so much the case
that I hear the trade of the ‘calenderer’
who used to make chintz as good
as new, has gone almost out of
existence.”</p>

<p>“Most of them told me that all my
washing would be ‘put out,’ and I should
get my own bill from the laundry,” said
Tom, who seemed considerably puzzled
by all these domestic ins and outs, but
not without some sound conviction
that they tended neither to his comfort
nor his prosperity.</p>

<p>“I did not find one house where they
were willing to give me dinner daily,”
Tom went on, “except boarding houses
with a lot of people in them. I don’t
like the idea of those at all. It is very
tiring and worrying to sit down every
evening at a dining-table packed with
strangers, most of whom will be replaced
in a week or two by another set of
strangers. And the very lowest fee of
these, for a top back room, so small,
and with a roof so sloping, that I
could not use my Indian clubs without
upsetting the furniture, is as much as I
gave Mrs. Mott for all my peace and
comfort&mdash;and then it doesn’t include the
washing! Yet I expect I’ll have to come
to this,” added Tom ruefully.</p>

<p>“I suppose the lodging-house keepers
can’t cook themselves, and can’t get
servants who can,” said Lucy. “And
oh, Mr. Black, many of the old style
lodging-house servants were terribly
overworked and underpaid and ill-treated.
I once went to get lessons
from a lady who had apartments in one
of these houses. She told me that there
was only one servant&mdash;an undersized
creature who had opened the door to me.
There were four sets of apartments
in that house, apart from her mistress’s
family of four people, and the girl got
no help, except a little in the cooking,
from the mistress’s aged mother. The
washing was done at home there, and
the servant did it all! My teacher told
me that the girl was on her feet and hard
at work from six o’clock in the morning
till after ten o’clock at night, and ‘the
worst of it was,’ she added, ‘the girl
was learning nothing, and getting so
used to scamped and slovenly work,
that she could never rise to anything
better than the same drudgery.’ She
had very low wages. A week’s illness
would mean the hospital. Her life’s
sole resting-place would be the workhouse.
We can’t be sorry for any
changes which end such a state of things,
can we, Mr. Black?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, certainly not,” he said,
“but are they ending? By the look of
the servants I saw in the big boarding-houses,
I shouldn’t think their lives are
much easier or better. They may have
higher wages. Mrs. Mott’s girls
certainly had a better time. They
were comfortable and happy when
they chose to be so. She paid them a
very fair wage, considering that she
taught them housework thoroughly.
She says that some of the girls she had
long ago went from her place to the
very best situations. One of them
afterwards married a young farmer, and
when she visits London she always
comes to see Mrs. Mott.”</p>

<p>“As for getting meals at restaurants,”
pursued poor Tom, “I can’t do it. I
can’t afford it. I know they are very
cheap; but somehow there doesn’t seem
much ‘bite’ in their platefuls. And
there’s such a noise, and such a hurry,
and such a horrid smell of food. If
fellows really have to come to that, I
don’t wonder they take to drinking and
smoking. There’s something unreasonable
about the whole thing. Here are
girls nowadays ready to do men’s work
for half men’s wages, so that fellows can
scarcely get work at all. When I was
in the City the other day I saw a great
crowd of men round an office. They
were pushing right up the stairway and
half across the road. I thought there
must have been a murder. I said to a
commissionaire who was standing by,
‘What’s up?’ ‘Oh,’ says he, ‘these
people are applying for a clerk’s place
that’s advertised.’ ‘Anything specially
good?’ I asked. ‘No, sir, only a pound
a week,’ he answered. And I know it’s
always so. Yet our ways of living are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_655">{655}</a></span>
getting dearer, and no woman is ready
to be well paid for doing what we can’t
do for ourselves. It’s inconsistent!
It’s abominable!”</p>

<p>Lucy could not help laughing.
“Don’t say ‘Women won’t do what
men can’t do,’” she answered. “Don’t
you know it is a favourite masculine
reflection on feminine inferiority that all
the great cooks are men! If that be so,
then men are also likely to be the best
average cooks. If they are so hard
pressed for work, why do not some of
them turn towards work which is crying
for workers, and in which we always hear
they could excel? A cook with a wage
of eighteen or twenty pounds a year,
and a thoroughly good home provided,
is far better off than the earner of a
weekly wage of a pound.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Tom, “I can well
believe that. But why can’t women
stick to cooking themselves? It’s
women’s work.”</p>

<p>“Not if they can’t do it so well as we
hear men can,” persisted Lucy.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it would seem a come-down
for a man,” Tom candidly confessed.
“A clerkship&mdash;domestic service;
they have a different sound.”</p>

<p>“Just so,” said Lucy, “and that
being the man’s standpoint, the girls
have naturally adopted it too. What
reason is there in such a standpoint?
On the face of it, which work is the more
honourable&mdash;securing and maintaining
the comfort of homes, or entering figures
in a ledger and addressing envelopes?
Which sphere gives the more scope for
individual talent and character? And
until this perverted standpoint is
changed, all our present miseries will
continue and increase. I have got my
share, and you are finding yours. What
is your housemate, Mr. Hinton, going
to do?”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the lucky ones!” said
Tom. “His married sister and her
husband are coming into London, and
they mean to let him have their spare
room.”</p>

<p>A sudden idea flashed upon Lucy’s
mind.</p>

<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>T. R. A. M. A.&mdash;We think you must be confusing
two poems. The lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p class="noindent">recur frequently in “Œnone,” a poem by Tennyson;
they may have been confused by someone
with the extract from Macaulay’s “Horatius,”
which you quote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“O Tiber, Father Tiber,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To whom the Romans pray,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">or may, of course, be foolishly introduced into a
parody upon the “Lay” in question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daffodil</span> (Portugal).&mdash;Thank you very much for
your interesting letter from Oporto. We like to
hear about your life. Your information is published
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bluebell.</span>&mdash;The extract you give is from Lord
Tennyson’s poem “Crossing the Bar.” You will
find it in the last volume of his works, and it begins
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Sunset, and evening star,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And one clear call for me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Agatha.</span>&mdash;We are pleased to have your letter from
the Sea-Bathing Hospital and hope you will soon
be stronger. As for your quotation from Longfellow&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“We should dread the desert behind us</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Worse than the dark before,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">it is true that in one sense one cannot “dread”
what is behind; and yet it seems to us the poet’s
meaning is clear. The world&mdash;life’s experience,
life’s memories&mdash;deprived of the presence of children,
would be more desolate and dreadful even
than “the dark” or the unknown future. One
must not be too strict in criticising poetical expressions,
and “to dread” may mean to feel distress or
horror, as well as apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss R. M. Jacob</span>, 8, Waldenshaw Road, Forest
Hill, London, S.E., sends us particulars of Correspondence
Lessons in the cane basket-work.
The method is her own and original, and she seems
already to be very successful in teaching. Girls
who need some fresh occupation will do well to
apply to Miss Jacob for particulars.</p>

<p>B. E. M.&mdash;1. There are a number of reading societies
you could join:&mdash;The National Home Reading
Union, Surrey House, Victoria Embankment, London;
“The Queen” Reading Club, Miss Isabel G.
Kent, Lay Rectory, Little Abington, Cambridge;
and one conducted by Mrs. Walker, Litlington
Rectory, Berwick, Sussex, besides many others
mentioned in this column from time to time.&mdash;2.
You might consult <i>Our Sketching Club: Letters
and Studies in Landscape Art</i>, by Rev. R. St.
John Tyrwhitt, M.A. (Macmillan); <i>Brushwork</i>,
first book, by Miss Yeats, published by Philip &amp; Son,
32, Fleet Street; or <i>Brushwork, or Painting without
Pencil Outline</i>, by D. Pearce, published by
Charles Dible, 10, Paternoster Square. Two questions
are our limit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peri.</span>&mdash;We have pleasure in telling you that the poem
you wish to find is called “The Man at the
Gate,” and is contained in a small volume entitled
“Ezekiel and other Poems, by B. M.” The book
was published some time ago by Nelson &amp; Sons at
3s. 6d., net price 2s. 7½d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nell Bell.</span>&mdash;Dear girl, your letter is so disfigured
by enormous blots and erasures that we really
cannot ask a French girl to correspond with you.
Your writing is good, and we are sure you could
send us a neat letter if you liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carnation</span> (Australia).&mdash;Write direct to Mademoiselle
Louise François, Anzin, Nord, France.</p>

<p>We have again much pleasure in noticing the Sketching
and Copying Clubs of Miss H. E. Grace,
54, York Road, Brighton. The subjects for the
fourteenth year, 1899-1900, seem chosen and named
in a felicitous manner. We thank Miss Grace for
her pleasant letter and enclosure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ancient Briton.</span>&mdash;Will Carleton’s “The First
Settler’s Story” is published in his book of <i>Farm
Ballads</i> and also appeared in <i>Our Own Gazette</i>
for February, 1893.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amédée.</span>&mdash;1. The building depicted in the frontispiece
to <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> for February is,
doubtless, the Parthenon (literally the virgin’s
chamber), or temple to the Goddess Athênê on the
Acropolis at Athens. This wonderful edifice was
built under the superintendence of Phidias, who
wrought in ivory and gold a colossal statue of the
goddess for the interior. The temple consisted of
an oblong central building flanked on all sides
by a peristyle of pillars. It is a little difficult to
say precisely what religious festival is here depicted;
but all the Greek religious festivals were
intermingled with the idea of gladness, procession,
and public rejoicing. We observe the lyre (Greek,
phorminx) as well as other instruments more
familiar. You might be interested in consulting
Smith’s <i>Student’s Greece</i>.&mdash;2. Without seeing the
picture you name we cannot explain it. Art that
makes the beauty of the past real to us has its own
value, even without any precise lesson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daffodil.</span>&mdash;Your sonnet, “The Soul’s Awakening,”
is decidedly above the average of lines sent us for
criticism. The thought is very good. There are a
few defects in the working out; the last two lines
do not rhyme with each other, or with any line,
and the accent on “sepulchre” is forced. But we
can on the whole give you sincere praise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia.</span>&mdash;We fear your description is not full enough
to enable us to help you as to the story you wish to
find. Is it by any chance <i>The Giant Killer; or,
the Battle that all must Fight</i>, by A. L. O. E.?
That opens with the sons of a clergyman (Mr. Roby)
quarrelling. Your outline reads rather like
A. L. O. E.’s style. Thanks for your reply to
<span class="smcap">Doubtful</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mab</span> (Scotland).&mdash;Your story is far too sentimental,
and shows a lack of knowledge of real life. A
complexion cannot be at once “tanned by exposure”
and “delicately tinted as a pink wild rose.”
At the same time your writing is not devoid of
force, and it is quite possible that with time and
study you might do better. There is no presumption
whatever in your sending to us; we are always
glad to advise our readers.</p></div>

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p>A. B. C.&mdash;Writer’s cramp is a name given to a
peculiar form of nervous disease of the right arm
and hand met with, almost exclusively, in writers.
The disease belongs to that class of afflictions
called “habit spasms,” other examples of which
are histrionic spasm, commonly called “stage
strike,” “musical stammering,” and some forms
of true stammering. Of the cause of writer’s
cramp we know this much, that it occurs mainly in
writers; that it is far more common in men than in
women; that it sometimes occurs in persons who
are run down in health; that it is more common
among the members of neurotic families, and that
it is most frequent in those writers who use their
wrists and little fingers as the “fulcrum” when
writing. It is very uncommon among type-writers.
There are many types of the complaint. In some
forms weakness or paralysis of the muscles of the
right hand is the most marked feature; in other
cases twitchings, cramps, or numbness are the
leading symptoms. The treatment for the affection
is perfectly simple, but, like most simple treatments,
it is very rarely that it is carried out. It is
absolute rest from writing. The disease is cured
by absolute rest. Where this treatment is impossible,
rest till all symptoms have subsided, and
then gradually taking to writing again, is the next
best thing. But the complaint is exceedingly
likely to recur. Learning to write with the left
hand, nothing like such a difficult proceeding as
you would think, has frequently been tried for
the trouble; sometimes with great success, but not
infrequently the disease attacks the left hand also.
Massage, galvanism, and other such measures are
sometimes used, but their effects are doubtful, and
they appear to have but little action. The same
may be said of strychnine and other nervine tonics.
Of drugs the most useful are malt, cod-liver oil,
and suchlike foods. Writer’s cramp is a serious
disease to writers, and, moreover, it is one which
they can never escape from if they must still
continue in their employment. It is far better to
throw over their writing at once, than wait till
they are obliged to do so by the disease crippling
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poor Humpback.</span>&mdash;The deformity resulting from
tubercular disease of the spine cannot be remedied.
Indeed, the deformity is the remedy for the effects
of the mischief. For in this condition the tubercle
germs have destroyed some of the bones of the back,
and the only way by which the strength of the
backbone is maintained is by the falling together
of the bones above and below the seat of the
trouble, and this, of necessity, produces shortness
and deformity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink May.</span>&mdash;You should not wash your hair too
often; if it is healthy, once a month is quite sufficiently
frequent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muriel.</span>&mdash;It is indeed a
difficult matter to clear
a complexion “disfigured
by innumerable
freckles,” but still we
can do a little to render
the marks less noticeable.
Freckles are small
patches of pigment. We
know there are fair and
dark complexions, and
a freckled complexion is
one which is both fair and
dark in patches. One
of the greatest causes of
excess of pigment in the
skin is light, and we all
know how likely we are to
get freckled or browned
after being in a strong
sun. It is not the heat,
but the light of the sun
which forms the pigment
in the skin, and the
bluer the light the more
rapidly it will form pigment.
Light reflected
from water is especially
potent in the formation of both browning and
freckles. If you want to escape freckles you must
therefore keep out of the light, and you can do
this by wearing a red veil or using a red parasol.
It is <i>said</i> that freckles can be bleached with
peroxide of hydrogen, but we have not seen much
benefit from its use. Glycerine and lime-water is
also said to remove freckles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Motherless Lass.</span>&mdash;Although all drugs are injurious
when taken regularly, if the reason why
they are taken is persistent, it is necessary to take
them regularly. It is taking drugs without reason
which is so dangerous, or taking them to combat a
complaint which is cured. Aloes is the best
habitual laxative we possess, and in most cases it
is the safest to employ, but in your case we do not
advise you to continue it, but to take a teaspoonful
of liquorice powder instead. For your anæmia we
advise bone-marrow tabloids or the peptonate of
iron. The tabloids are often exceedingly useful,
but they must be taken with care. Begin by
taking one tabloid crushed up in milk twice a
day, after food. After a week take two tabloids
twice a day. Do not exceed this amount. If
headache, dizziness, or trembling occurs, drop
the tabloids for a week, then take to them again
gradually. Most of your troubles are due to
anæmia, but this again is connected with what you
tell us in the latter part of your letter. Unfortunately
we cannot enter at length into the subject.
We can only encourage you to persevere and
never to give up the struggle, however often you
may fail. You cannot expect to have good health
unless you improve your way of living. As regards
the medical part of the question, you should take
plenty of healthy exercise and seek the companionship
of others. Above all, be careful of what you
read. Frivolous literature is a terrible evil which
must be shunned without ceasing. And above all,
do not despair; we are all weak and fail sometimes,
but if we do our best and strive to do better, we
may in time overcome our failings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primrose.</span>&mdash;There are certain soaps which “won’t
wash clothes,” and there are others which will not
wash faces&mdash;or rather, will not wash them without
injury. Girls should always be careful not to use
coarse or strong soaps for toilet use. A soap
made to scrub floors or soiled clothes is not
suitable to wash a face. For floors, etc., you want
a strong, coarse soap. But the human face is a
delicate article, and should be cleaned with soap
made with great care, with no coarse or biting
principles to spoil the complexion. All soaps sold
for the toilet, except patent ones, are made of
refined materials carefully selected and blended;
and it is these soaps, and these only, which should
be used for toilet purposes. Patent soaps should
never be used, not because they are impure, but
because their preparation is secret, and nobody
knows from what they are made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Hothouse Rose.</span>&mdash;Read the answer to “Poor
Humpback.” Tuberculosis of the spine is distinctly
a curable disease, though usually some deformity,
more or less slight, is left after the disease has
ceased. The treatment is chiefly a question of
absolute rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious One.</span>&mdash;We cannot tell you what causes the
pain in your left side without any information about
it. It is probably indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Anxious One.</span>&mdash;You are very wrong to go
about untreated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myall.</span>&mdash;Coal gas is an intensely poisonous vapour.
Unlike the “choke-damp” of miners, which is carbonic
acid gas, coal gas is not only irrespirable,
but is actually poisonous. A very small quantity
of gas in the air of a room may produce alarming
results in anybody sleeping in the room. We are
all familiar, at all events through the newspaper,
with the immense danger of gas escaping into a
bedroom. “How the body of &mdash;&mdash; was found in
bed, and an escape of gas noticed,” etc. But few
people are aware of the danger of a little gas
escaping from a defective bracket or burner. Yet
many cases of chronic failing health can be traced
to this cause&mdash;gas escaping into the bedroom,
often in such small quantities as to be undetected
till searched for. Coal gas acts directly on the
blood and destroys its function. When a person
is found unconscious in a room in which gas is
escaping, she should be immediately taken out into
the open air and artificial respiration employed at
once. But only too frequently no effort is of any
avail. Charcoal burned with a limited supply of
air gives out the same gas as the poisonous factor
in coal gas, namely, carbon monoxide. This gas
has no smell, and therefore it is not the poisonous
constituent of coal gas which gives it the characteristic
odour. Amongst the symptoms which may
be met with in persons who sleep in a room into
which a minute quantity of coal gas escapes, are
headache, lassitude, especially in the morning,
worrying dreams and anæmia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Mother Hubbard.</span>&mdash;1. Sallowness of the complexion
is one of the commonest symptoms met with
in ill-health. Practically any form of illness may
cause it. It is almost invariably present in chronic
constipation.&mdash;2. Yes. One decayed tooth may
injure every other tooth in the head, just as one
rotten apple will spoil a whole sackful. Decayed
teeth are not the least good to anybody; they
cannot be used for mastication, and they are not
beautiful. But they are exceedingly dangerous, and
there are more deaths due to carious teeth than
you would ever have suspected! The moral of
this is obvious: decayed teeth should be removed
or stopped at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Disdain.</span>&mdash;To ask us what natural mineral
waters are advised for chronic rheumatism is a
very large order. The action of most waters is
profoundly obscure, and chronic rheumatism is an
equally profoundly obscure disease, so, of course, it
is for chronic rheumatism that most mineral springs
come into existence. The mere mention of the
names of all the waters used for this complaint would
occupy a volume. And, moreover, we do not know
the names of more than about one in six. But we
think that we know the most important of those
that have really any value. The sulphur waters
are decidedly useful in chronic rheumatism. The
best are Harrowgate and Aix-la-Chapelle. All
the vast horde of alkaline waters have been advised
for rheumatism. Seltzers, Vals, Vichy, Contréxeville,
and Alet waters are those chiefly in use.
Kreuznach and Woodhall, both of which contain
iodine, and Royat, which contains chlorides, are
often of great value in chronic joint affections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Distressed Mother.</span>&mdash;In cases where children
cannot digest milk&mdash;which is almost always due to
using milk badly prepared&mdash;and in the far more
common cases of children requiring extra nourishment,
either as the result of wasting disease or just
before their taking a more solid diet, do not supplement
their food with the patent foods sold for the
purpose. These are never what is wanted, and
they are frequently exceedingly injurious. A very
excellent supplemental food for such cases is the
following. It is difficult to make and is rather expensive,
but it is in its way almost a perfect food.
Follow the directions carefully:&mdash;Take four ounces
of stale bread without crust (it is better that the
bread be made with “seconds” flour); soak the
bread for eight hours, squeeze it dry and then boil
it in fresh water. Strain it, and rub it through a
hair sieve, and allow it to cool. This forms a sort
of jelly, and is called “bread jelly.” It is frequently
ordered by physicians, and is the first
ingredient of this excellent food. The second
ingredient is meat juice. To make this, take four
ounces of the best rump steak, obtained from a very
trustworthy butcher, and shred it up fine. To it
add one ounce (two tablespoonfuls) of cold water,
previously sterilised by boiling, and squeeze the
meat and the water through a muslin bag. Now
to proceed. Take five teaspoonfuls of the bread
jelly, six of the meat juice, two of fresh cream, and
half a teaspoonful of white sugar. Two ounces of
this food makes an excellent meal for an infant.
You must be very careful to see that everything
used in the making of this food is scrupulously
clean. The bread jelly and the meat juice must
be prepared fresh every day, and the cream must
be obtained from a thoroughly reliable source.</p></div>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
